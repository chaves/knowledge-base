## Population

### US Census

### HSN

- Link to data : https://socialhistory.org/en/hsn/hsn-download-service
- Description: The HSN offers a representative sample of about 78.000 people born in the Netherlands during the period 1812-1922. The HSN-database containing individual life-courses is a unique tool for research in Dutch history and demography. The province of Utrecht was selected because of its central position and because it has an appropriate number of births for this pilot project, about 5% of the total of Dutch births between 1812 and 1920. Moreover, it is a region which is, in such aspects as religion, probably the most representative of the Netherlands as a whole.

### Mormonsâ€™ genealogical data

- Link to data : Accessible on main page.
- Description: In the past, the Mormon genealogy records consisted of extracted data and member submissions (the IGI, Ancestral File, and Pedigree Resource File), but the new FamilySearch site offers rich international collections of historical records that consist of vital records, census records, and military records. Many of the record collections have online images that can be downloaded for free. New databases are being added at a quick pace and are browseable until the indexes are completed. You may have to create and sign into a Family Search account, but it is always free.


## Dealth and Diseases

### Human mortality database
- Link: http://www.mortality.org
- Link to data : By country, accessible on main page.
- Description: The Human Mortality Database (HMD) was created to provide detailed mortality and population data to researchers, students, journalists, policy analysts, and others interested in the history of human longevity. The project began as an outgrowth of earlier projects in the Department of Demography at the University of California, Berkeley, USA, and at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany (see history). It is the work of two teams of researchers in the USA and Germany (see research teams), with the help of financial backers and scientific collaborators from around the world (see acknowledgements). The Center on the Economics and Development of Aging (CEDA) French Institute for Demographic Studies (INED) has also supported the further development of the database in recent years.
