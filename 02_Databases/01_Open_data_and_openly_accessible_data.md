### Learn more about it
Towards Open Science \[1\] is a movement to make scientific research, data and dissemination accessible
to all levels of an inquiring society (see «TreeTaxonomic»
[*https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/*](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/)).

## Open Government data


**What is Open Government Data?** Open government data means \[2\]:

-   Data produced or commissioned by government or government controlled
    entities.

-   Data which is open as defined in the [*Open
    Definition*](http://www.opendefinition.org/) – that is, it can be
    freely used, reused and redistributed by anyone.

**Why Open Government Data?** There are three main reasons \[2\]:

1.  Transparency: not just access, but also sharing and reuse.

2.  Releasing social and commercial value : creation of innovative
    business and services that deliver social and commercial value.

3.  Participatory Governance: making a full “read/write” society,
    able to contribute to the process of governance.

Many governments created online portals to publish their data, ex.:

-   France: [*https://www.data.gouv.fr/*](https://www.data.gouv.fr/)

-   UK: [*https://data.gov.uk/*](https://data.gov.uk/)

-   USA: [*https://www.data.gov/*](https://www.data.gov/)

For the European Union, two portals are available:

1.  The [*EU Open Data Portal*](http://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data): gives
    access to open data from the EU institutions, agencies and other
    bodies.

2.  The [*Public Data*](http://publicdata.eu/) portal: provides datasets
    from local, regional and national public bodies across Europe.

## Linked Open Data (LOD)

The term ‘‘Linked Data’’ refers to the trend of connecting and
publishing data using the web. It aims to publish not only documents but
also data, and contributes to the extension of the web into a global
data space based on open standards (semantic web standards: RDF,
SPARQL). This data space is called the ‘’Web of data’’ \[3\].

It was created in response to two main questions:

1.  *How to publish data that is reusable?*
2.  *How to promote the integration of data from different sources?*

The proposed solutions consist in imposing a structure on the data to
facilitate their sharing and reuse and to use a standard model to
facilitate their discovery and integration.

Linked Data definition from <http://linkeddata.org/> :

*“Linked Data is about using the Web to connect related data that wasn't
previously linked, or using the Web to lower the barriers to linking
data currently linked using other methods. More specifically, Wikipedia
defines Linked Data as "a term used to describe a recommended best
practice for exposing, sharing, and connecting pieces of data, information and knowledge
on the Semantic Web using [URIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI) and
[RDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework)." ”*

A significant number of organizations have adopted the principles of
linked data as a way to publish their data, which has created a global
space of interconnected data consisting of several billions of RDF
triples from many sources: geographical data, statistics, genetic data,
medical data, scientific publications,
movies, music, etc. (see figure below, http://lod-cloud.net/ ).
